# Launching the Virtual Environment

In order to launch the virtual environment, make sure you are in the tp_multithreading folder. Then you need to use this line in the command terminal :
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```
If the operation is succesful, you should see this before your directory : (.venv)

# Using the Queue Manager with Python

To use the Queue Manager with Python, you need to follow these steps :

1. Run manager.py in a dedicated terminal
2. Run boss.py in a dedicated terminal
3. Run minion.py in a dedicated terminal

Steps 2 and 3 can be reversed. You can run as many Minions as you want.

The number of tasks created by the Boss can be changed by modifying the for loop in the main function of boss.py.
